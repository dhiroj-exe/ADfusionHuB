# 🎟️ ADfusionHuB – The Ultimate Static Ticket Booking Website

**ADfusionHuB** is a beginner-friendly but visionary HTML & CSS-based web project, built in **Class 9** by two passionate students. Inspired by BookMyShow, this platform allows users to **explore and book tickets** for a wide range of events, including:

🎬 **Movies**  
🎤 **Stand-up Comedy**  
📽️ **Documentaries**  
🎧 **Music Concerts**

> 💡 Users can also preview trailers before making a booking – all with no JavaScript, just clean and efficient HTML/CSS.
